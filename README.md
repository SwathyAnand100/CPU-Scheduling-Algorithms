# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
This project implements the CPU Scheduling Algorithms namely the First In First Out(FIFO), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) and the Round Robin(RR). The user can input the processes as and when they like and the Ready Queue and the Blocked Queue will be displayed at every instant. 
Since one CPU clock cycle is much much small when compared to 1 sec, it may not be possible to differentiate the outputs between every algorithm unless and until the user inputs values continuously and very large.
Also note that the input must be given in the form of CPU Burst + I/O Burst + CPU Burst.
